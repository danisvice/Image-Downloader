## Introduction

The Image Downloader is a Rust application designed to effortlessly download images from the web. It utilizes the `reqwest` library for making HTTP requests and includes error handling to provide clear and concise error messages.

## Error Handling

We've implemented error handling using the `error_chain` crate to ensure smooth execution. Here are the main error types:

- `Io`: Represents errors related to input and output operations.
- `HttpRequest`: Handles errors related to HTTP requests using `reqwest`.

## How it Works

This program performs the following steps:

1. Creates a temporary directory to store the downloaded image.
2. Specifies the target URL of the image you want to download.
3. Sends an HTTP GET request to the target URL.
4. Retrieves the image's binary content from the HTTP response.
5. Determines the filename based on the URL path or uses a default name.
6. Saves the image to the temporary directory.
7. Provides information about the downloaded image, including its location.

## Usage

To use the Image Downloader program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Rust installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-downloader.git
   cd image-downloader
   ```

3. Build and run the program:

   ```bash
   cargo build
   cargo run
   ```

   This will execute the program and download the image to a temporary directory, displaying details about the download.
